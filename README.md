# Socket.IO Get Started

This repo is based on [Socket.IO getting started guide](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/)

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Run

```sh
node index.js
```

## Some ideas to improve the application:

- Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects
- Add support for nicknames
- Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
- Add “{user} is typing” functionality
- Show who’s online
- Add private messaging
